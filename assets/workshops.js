So little of it is actually conscious and alert decision making... this hidden Mind affects your every behavior, decision and thought without your knowing.

Gaining control of this unconscious Mind will allow you to manifest your true desires and intentions seamlessly and completely, without interference from limiting beliefs stemming from ideas rooted in your Unconscious Mind. Here we explore techniques to gain control over our Unconscious Mind.",

This workshop will consist of various exercises that will propel us men into more poignant connection with ourselves and each other, as well as provide men with a safe platform to dive deeper into themselves and shed their old baggage that no longer serves them.",

    'name': 'Yoga Nidra',
    'bio': "​The practice of yoga found Kyle Ann in 2011. She moved to Arizona and began studying Hatha Yoga, Reiki and Toe Reading. With seven years of practice and experience, she is honored to hold a safe container for others to dive deep within their own depths. In the space of Yoga Nidra we are able to witness our thoughts and recognize we are not our thoughts. When we have control over our thoughts, rather than our thoughts or Ego mind having control over us, we are able to live a more peaceful life. Yoga Nidra is a sleep based technique that is accessible to everyone. In a Yoga Nidra session the body goes into very deeply relaxed states and the brain is guided into delta brainwave levels. Here, awareness is completely detached, allowing all to be as it is, relieving stress and anxieties. Once this feeling is known and visited often, we are able to stay here in our waking lives. We remain unaffected by anything outside of ourselves. Knowing our inner truth and contentment. Yoga Nidra reprograms the brain to allow us to flow through life with more ease and fulfillment by replacing unhelpful habits with new, healthy habits with the use of intention. In this workshop we will learn a few ways to create a custom intention that can be used to shift your consciousness to a higher vibration.",
